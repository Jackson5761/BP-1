## What is Open Source?

For a project/software to be open source means that the source code is able to be accessed freely and portions may be edited and redistributed.

## What Surprised Me?

What I found most surprising is the amount of collaborative tools and methods that come with being part of an open source project, such as the idea of pulling and pushing code from and to the cloud to avoid costly mistakes in the main branch.

In addition to these open source softwares, large companies such as Google host open source projects instead of Google as a whole being open source.

#### Why it Matters

For entirely open source projects, take Blender for example, this means that the community that utilizes this software is able to have a stronger voice in changes to the software than if it was not open source. For large companies like Google, this allows them to benefit from the extra volunteer development/ideas from open source while still keeping key aspects of their software proprietary.
